# plsr.github.io
This page aims to be something as close as possible to a personal blog of mine,
but just not very active.  

The page is hosted via github pages and run by jekyll.

## Development
1. Clone this repository
```
git clone git@github.com:Plsr/plsr.github.io.git
```

2. Change to the new directroty and install the needed dependnecies
```
cd plsr.github.io
bundle install
```

3. Serve the site locally
```
jekyll serve
```

4. You're cooking with gas! The site is now server at `localhost:4000` âœ¨

an article), contributions are always welcome.

If you only want to report, just open an
[Issue](https://github.com/Plsr/plsr.github.io/issues/new).

If you want to fix stuff right away, open a pull request.
