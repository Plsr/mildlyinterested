I need to do things every day. Doing things involves some steps, none of which is particularly complicated. In reality, however, I tend to screw up at least one of these steps, which leads to me doing things on an unsatisfactory level. I’m writing my idea of doing things down, so it becomes a real thing, a sort of physical item in this world. Something I cannot deny existing so easy. One less excuse for my brain to make.   
This guide is perfect for you if you’re me, right now. Your milage may vary if
you're not me.

I’m 26 and have no clue about live, just so you’ve been warned.

#### Identify what needs to be done
Of course, you need to know what you need to do. That also includes committing to do one thing and not doing the myriad of other things you could also be doing. There are different situations in life where the act of identifying what to to is more or less up to you. But even if you are at work and get a task handed to you, you have a lot of identification work to. Maybe the task consists of many sub-tasks, to one of which you need to commit first. Maybe the task is utter bullshit and so your next task becomes to convince whomever needs to be convinced that this might be a bad use of resources.  
Whatever you decide to to, you should be sure that the thing you’re going to do is the best thing you can do in the moment. [Sam Altman wrote about that in detail recently.](https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity)

#### Make time for it
Doing work needs time. Doing great work needs large blocks of uninterrupted time (I recommend reading [Deep Work by Cal Newport](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/)). Try to figure out how much time the given task may need. If you are not sure or cannot estimate it properly, give it at least an hour. Usually tasks will take as long as you give them, so thats one thing to bear in mind as well.  
If you cannot make room to get to a decent point that you can pick up on later, don’t start. The work you’ll produce will most likely not be worth it. Do something else with your time and don’t waste it on half-assed work. (Some ideas might be to read something that makes you better in some way, take a walk and recover, or get some chore work out of the way).

#### Get the tools you’ll need
Different tasks require different tools. Identify which tools you need, and use them. Don’t trick yourself into using things that you don’t actually need. If the task can be accomplished with just a notebook and a pen, there is no need to also have coffee on the desk, and a piece of cake, and a computer just to be safe and maybe also all the pens you own just in case you need to color something. Same goes for working on the computer. If you’re programming, there is absolutely no need for you to also have your mail program and twitter and two personal messengers and a news site open.
Go for the bare minimum you need to accomplish the task, ditch everything else.

#### Work until finished
You’re properly set up, start working. Do nothing but work on that task. You know its important and the best use you can currently make of your time, so trust yourself and focus. If something else turns up in the meantime, decide if its an emergency. If it’s not (pro tip: [most emergencies aren’t](https://www.theminimalists.com/emergencies/)), write it down somewhere to get it out of your head, decide on what to do about it later.  
Remember to take breaks (I currently use the pomodoro technique, there are other options that might suit you better), but don’t lose focus. Try to stay in the zone. Get up, or drink some water. Don’t check Twitter. From my personal experience, it’s best not to talk to anyone in the break. Try to avoid input when you’re generating output as much as possible.

Basically, it’s as simple as that. I am very certain that I’ll have to visit this often in the future. I’m excited for the point when I disagree with it.
