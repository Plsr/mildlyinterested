I was thinking about the universe last night. This sounds bigger than it really was, to be honest, I was mostly watching video on YouTube about it. In one of the videos, that covered the theory of multiverses, I came across a thought that I had in my mind for a while now: There is no such thing as reality. While there may be an objective thing like the world (or the universe), we can only interact with it through our subjective perception.  
This means that your interpretation of the world is different from mine. They seem to be somewhat similar, since we can talk about it and understand each other, but nobody can tell to what degree.

Let's think about colors: When we see the color we agreed on is "red", we might be seeing the exact same thing. But your red could also be a slightly different shade of red than mine (which could be a part of an explanantion why tastes in design differ so much). I think that it could also be possible that your red is what I call blue. It's all just definition.  
What this means is that there are as many realtities as there are conscious beings in the universe. They might all be covered by a base reality, but they might all be different to an unknown degree.

While I was thinking about this, another thought crossed my mind: How can I be sure that anything except for my thoughts is real at all? I cannot. Maybe everything that exists is drawn into existence in real time because I think about it. 

I think now is a good time for a little break. When you read this, you might think that this is crazy, and you are right. It's a hard thought to wrap your mind around, and I believe that if you really start believing in a world view like this, there is a good chance that you may go mad. However, it is interesting to just think about this and what it could mean, would it be true. After all, my own existence is the only thing that I can know with certainty.

After lingering with the thought for a bit, I naturally went to the internet to see if there is someone else who thought about this ("Am I the only person alive" must be on of the stranger Google searches I did over the years), and there is. Ther is a whole school of philosophy around this topic, and it is called Solipsism. Here's Wikipedia:

> Solipsism [...] is the philosophical idea that only one's mind is sure to exist. As an epistemological position, solipsism holds that knowledge of anything outside one's own mind is unsure; the external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist outside the mind.

I don't want to write about the definition of this too much, you can read about that yourself if you wanted or watch this video by vsauce.  
What's more interesting is what comes if you, just for a brief time, assume that this school of thought is true. The questions that arise after that, all wht "why?"s. Let's look at some of them, shall we?
